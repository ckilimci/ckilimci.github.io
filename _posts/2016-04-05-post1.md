Sienfeld. Many of you know Jerry Seinfeld is a comedian but do you know that he has a method for creativity. He wanted to be successful comedian and thought what he should do. Result is not coming from Mars: better jokes better comedian. And asked himself how he can do better jokes. Again, the answer is not complicated: make practice. And creates a method: *Don\`t Break the Chain*. 

Many blog posts should be online what it is, I am not going to explain it here. So you may ask why did you wrote all these about? I put myself here to be more productive person on the internet. Everyday we reach online article, news, comments and so on. But we rarely produce one. So I am going to put something, I don\`t know even little thing, I put something on the internet useful and won\`t break my own chain.

Cheers
